# Traffic-light

This is a school project. Where I use arduino pro to make a traffic-light. 
The coding is the small part, where I make the lights light up in the right order.
The big work is put in on the constucitve part. Where I build a traffic light with cardboard, glue, cords, led lamps and a arduino pro.
